      //1. Create your own food.
      
      //2. Try to print out the name of your food.
      //   Can you print it with a method? (Does the method currently exist)
      //   Can you print it with the attribute?
      
      //3. Try to print out the weight of the food.
      //   Can you print it with a method? (Does the method currently exist)
      //   Can you print it with the attribute? 
      
      
      //4. Can you change the name of the food?
      //   Why might we not want to change the food name?
      
      
      //5. In the food class, is the access modifier for weight public or private?
      //   Answer:
      
      
      //6. Change the weight to -50, and print it out.  Is it possible?
      
      
      //7. Why might we not want to have a public attribute?
      //   What could be a suitable method to allow us to change the attribute?
      
      
      
      //8. Can you heat up the food? Alternate heating up the food and printing the temperature.
      //   How does it act?
      
      
      //9. Finish adding commenting to the Food class.
